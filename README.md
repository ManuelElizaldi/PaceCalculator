# RunningPaceCalculator
## Project Description
The idea for this project was born from the constant 'pain' that came with trying to compare my running pace to my friends'. I measure my runs in kilometers, but my friends use miles. After every run me and my friends would discuss our workout and it was hard to understand eachother, so I decided to build a tool that would convert our running paces. 

## Overview
The web app was build using the package streamlit (version 1.27.2) and deployed on (Render)[https://render.com/]. 
pandas==2.0.3
