## Project Description
The idea for this project was born from the constant discomfort that came with trying to compare my running pace to my friends'. I have trained all my life measuring my runs in kilometers, but my friends use miles. After every run me and my friends would discuss our workout, and it was complicated to understand each other, not knowing how hard we had trained. So, I decided to take this inconvenience as a coding challenge and build a tool that would solve our measurement translation problem. 

## Overview
The web app was build using the package streamlit (version 1.27.2) and deployed with [Render](https://render.com/). 
Additionally Pandas (version 2.0.3) was used for some data handling. 

The web app has 3 sections:
- Pace Converter: This will convert your minutes/kilometers to minutes/miles and vice versa.
- Pace Calculator: If you don't know how was you were running, in this section you can enter your distance and time and you'll recieve your running pace. 
- Unit Conversion: Lastely, this section will convert from kilometers to miles and conversely.

You can access the web app here: [Running Pace Calculator](https://runningpacecalculator.onrender.com/)

## Conclusion and Knowledge Gained
When I first started developing the website for this project I faced a roudblock that offered a lesson. Initially I planned to use Heroku to deploy my webapp, but soon realized that their free tier service was terminated. I was determined and this obstacle was not going to stop me, I still wanted to build my project, so I did some research on potential alternatvies and found out about a couple options but ultimatiley I decied on Render since the deployment process was fairly simple. 

## Future Plans For This Project
My next step for this project is to build an app that can be used in android phones (possibly iphones too) without needing access to the internet.
