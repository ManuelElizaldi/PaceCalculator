# RunningPaceCalculator
## Project Description
The idea for this project was born from the constant 'pain' that came with trying to compare my running pace to my friends'. I am used to measuring my runs in kilometers, but my friends use miles. After every run me and my friends would discuss our workout and it was hard to understand eachother, so I decided to build a tool that would convert our running paces.
